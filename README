ll: A simple, lightweight cluster node locker


0. Download and Install

% git clone git://github.com/yasuhito/ll.git


1. Basic Usage

The basic usage is very simple. For example, you can lock a node named
node001 for 1 hour as follows:

ken% ll lock node001
ken% ll show
node001:
  [ken] 2010/03/02 (Tue) 13:59 - 14:59

Of cource, others cannot acquire a new lock while a previous lock is
alive. That is, the following attempt fails with exit -1.

akira% ll lock node001
Failed to lock node001
node001:
  [ken] 2010/03/02 (Tue) 13:59 - 14:59


2. Advanced Usage

The duration of a lock can be specified with natural time format.

Use node001 today.
% ll lock node001 today

Use node001 for two weeks.
% ll lock node001 2weeks

Use node001 three days from the next friday.
% ll lock node001 3days --from "next friday"


3. Multiple Nodes

ken% ll lock node002,node003,node004
node002:
  [ken] 2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:01 - 15:01
node003:
  [ken] 2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:01 - 15:01
node004:
  [ken] 2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:01 - 15:01

If you want to lock a number of nodes, use seq command.
For example, you can lock from node000 to node096 as follows:

% ll lock `seq --separator="," -f 'node%03g' 0 96`


4. Listing Current Locks

`ll show' shows current locks.

ken% ll show
node001:
  [ken] 2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:17 - 15:17
  [akira] 2010/03/05 (Fri) 12:00 - 03/08 (Mon) 12:00


5. Unlock

Expired locks are automatically unlocked. If you want to explicitly
unlock nodes, use `ll unlock' command:

% ll unlock node001
node001:
  0) [ken] 2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:16 - 15:16
  1) [akira] 2010/03/05 (Fri) 12:00 - 2010/03/08 (Mon) 12:00
Select (0..1)

When `ll unlock' finds locks with the same duration, `ll unlock'
prompts if unlock them or not.

ken% ./ll unlock node00
node00:
  [ken] 2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:22 - 15:22
