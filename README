ll: A simple, lightweight cluster resource locker


1. Basic Usage

The basic usage is very simple. For example, you can lock a node named
node001 for 1 hour as follows:

% ll lock node001
node001:
  2010/03/02 (Tue) 13:59 - 14:59

Of cource, others cannot acquire a new lock while the previous lock is
alive. This attempt fails with exit -1.

% ll lock node001
Failed to lock node001
node001:
  2010/03/02 (Tue) 13:59 - 14:59


2. Advanced Usage

The duration of a lock can be specified with natural time format.

Use node001 today.
% ll lock node001 today

Use node001 for two weeks.
% ll lock node001 2weeks

Use node001 three days from the next friday.
% ll lock node001 3days --from "next friday"


3. Multiple Locks

% ll lock node002,node003,node004
node002:
  2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:01 - 15:01
node003:
  2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:01 - 15:01
node004:
  2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:01 - 15:01

If you want to lock a number of nodes, use seq command.
For example, you can lock from node00 to node96 as follows:

% ll lock `seq --separator="," -f 'node%02g' 0 96`


4. Listing Current Locks

`ll show' shows current locks.

% ll show
node001:
  2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:17 - 15:17
  2010/03/05 (Fri) 12:00 - 03/08 (Mon) 12:00


5. Unlock

Expired locks are automatically unlocked. If you want to explicitly
unlock nodes, use `ll unlock' command:

% ll unlock node001
node001:
  0) 2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:16 - 15:16
  1) 2010/03/05 (Fri) 12:00 - 2010/03/08 (Mon) 12:00
Select (0..1)

When `ll' finds locks with same duration, `ll' prompts if unlock them
or not.

% ./ll unlock node00
node00:
  2010/03/02 (Tue) 14:22 - 15:22
Unlock? [Y/n]
